# Introduction 
The repository aims to provide the script for generating random IP and Port ranges for data generation purposes. The generated IPs will be placed in a log file to depict the logs generated by CGNAT devices.

## Log Format
Initially the format for the logs in the file will be as follows:
- One log per entry line
- The log entry will be formatted **Timestamp - PrivateIP:PrivatePort -> PublicIP:PublicPort**
